    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Had been a front-end web developer for about two years in Bitmain, I am now having great passion of learning border aspects and want to become more influential. In the future, I want to build my own web application the same as notion or transfix, using the most advanced technology and make people work more effectively.
